About the software:
===================

Shared Folder Chat is a program for chatting via a shared folder in a local area 
network (LAN).

It uses directories called ".chat" to save ".msg"-files inside which contain the 
information about the message. That is the author and the message text. The files' 
names are the actual system time in milliseconds with ".msg" attached.

To create a new chat click on "Create a new chat" and select a directory to create a 
new directory called ".chat" inside. The message will be saved in this directory and 
the chat will be shown in the chat list on the left.

To enter a already existing chat click on "Enter a chat". Select the ".chat"-directory 
which contains the messages of the conversation you want to enter. You will be able to
see the chat in the chat list on the left.

If you want to leave the selected chat simply click on "Leave the chat".

To send a message enter it into the right one of the editable text fields on the bottom
and press enter.

To change your username enter it into the left one of the editable text fields on the 
bottom.

Notifications will be shown if a new message is sent by another one in the selected 
chat. You can enable/disable notifications in the context menu of the chat list.

To change the program's updating time right click on the chat list and select "Set 
updating time".

You can change the window's title and icon by opening the context menu at any free space of the window.
